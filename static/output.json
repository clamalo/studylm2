Unlike computers, animal brains reflect their evolutionary history, where new capabilities are often built upon pre-existing structures (a concept known as 'Bauplan'). This leads to incremental, constrained changes. Paul Cisek's ontology provides an evolutionary framework for understanding cognition, starting from basic life functions like metabolism and replication, branching into physiology and behavior. Foundational behaviors observed across many animals, such as avoiding harm (e.g., turning away from sudden light changes) and approaching resources, are linked to early neural organization, potentially explaining contralateral control. Sensation is defined as the initial process of converting physical energy (like light) into neural signals, while perception is the subsequent process of organizing, interpreting, and integrating these signals to understand the environment.",

Its primary goals are to recognize elements in the environment, assign value to them, and guide appropriate actions. However, this process faces significant challenges. Ambiguity arises because a single retinal image can correspond to multiple real-world objects or scenes (e.g., Necker cube, Rubin's vase). Context plays a crucial role; the surrounding information influences our interpretation (e.g., 'the dress' illusion). The invariance challenge means our visual system must recognize an object as the same despite variations in how it appears on the retina due to different viewpoints, distances (size), or lighting conditions. Conversely, the selectivity challenge involves distinguishing different objects that might cast similar images on the retina. Gibson highlighted that perception is intrinsically linked to action; moving our body, head, or eyes generates new information (like motion parallax, a depth cue) that helps resolve these challenges and understand the 3D structure of the world.",

This involves extracting basic features from the physical stimulus.

'Complex cells' also respond to oriented edges but are less sensitive to the exact location within their larger receptive field; many are also sensitive to the direction of motion. V1 is highly organized. It contains a precise retinotopic map, where adjacent parts of the visual field are mapped onto adjacent parts of V1, although the fovea receives disproportionately large representation (cortical magnification). V1 is also organized into columns: ocular dominance columns contain cells that respond preferentially to input from either the left or right eye, while orientation columns contain cells that respond best to edges of the same orientation. By comparing the slightly different images received by the two eyes (binocular disparity), V1 computes depth information (stereopsis). V1 is crucial for conscious visual perception.",

Evidence for this functional segregation comes from lesion studies. For instance, damage to specific areas within these streams can cause selective deficits. Area V4, part of the ventral stream, is critical for color perception; damage can lead to cerebral achromatopsia, where the patient loses the ability to perceive colors despite intact cones. Area V5 (also known as MT - Middle Temporal), considered part of the dorsal stream but crucial for both, is vital for motion perception; damage can cause akinetopsia, where motion appears as a series of snapshots (Patient L.M.).

While V1 neurons respond to simple oriented lines, V2 neurons might respond to combinations like angles or intersections, V4 to more complex shapes, and IT cortex to whole objects like faces or specific items. Concurrently, the receptive fields of these neurons generally increase in size. This pooling of information over larger areas helps achieve viewpoint and size invariance â€“ recognizing an object regardless of its specific position or size on the retina. However, this comes at the cost of reduced spatial precision. The combination of inputs from neurons in earlier areas allows neurons in later areas to represent more complex and abstract features. Damage at different stages of this hierarchy results in different types of visual agnosia, a failure to recognize objects despite intact basic visual abilities. More posterior lesions might cause apperceptive agnosia (difficulty perceiving shapes), while more anterior lesions might cause associative agnosia (difficulty linking a perceived shape to its meaning or name) or category-specific agnosias like prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces).",

        "narrative": "The Dorsal Visual Stream runs from V1 upwards into the parietal lobe. Initially termed the 'Where' pathway for its role in spatial localization, it's now often called the 'How' pathway, emphasizing its crucial function in guiding actions based on spatial information. This stream doesn't just represent space abstractly; it creates 'action-oriented representations' â€“ coding visual information in ways directly relevant for interacting with objects (e.g., coding an object's orientation for grasping). Andy Clark argued that the primary goal of perception is guiding action. Evidence for this distinct pathway comes from patients with specific lesions. Patient DF, with ventral stream damage causing apperceptive agnosia, couldn't recognize objects or judge line orientations, but could accurately orient her hand to 'post' a card through a slot, suggesting her dorsal stream was intact. Conversely, patients with dorsal stream damage (e.g., Patient RV) exhibit Optic Ataxia â€“ a profound difficulty in using visual information to accurately reach for and grasp objects, even though they can often recognize the objects perfectly well. The Ebbinghaus illusion provides further evidence: while people perceive the central circle as larger when surrounded by small circles (ventral stream processing), their hand forms the same grip aperture when asked to pick it up, suggesting the dorsal stream uses accurate size information for action.",

The brain must integrate visual information with a representation of the self â€“ knowing where the body parts are, how they can move, and their current state. It also needs detailed spatial information about the target: its direction, distance (near vs. far), and crucially, its location *relative to the self*. This involves using different reference frames. For example, initial visual input is eye-centered, but to reach for an object, this information might need transformation into head-centered or body-centered coordinates. The parietal cortex is a major hub for this integration. It receives input from visual (especially dorsal stream areas like MT/MST involved in motion), somatosensory (touch, body position), and auditory systems, converging in areas like the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC). This convergence allows the brain to construct a dynamic representation of the body within its spatial environment, relating the external world to the self to plan and execute actions.",

This enables 'perceptually guided actions,' like adjusting your grasp to pick up a coffee cup you are currently looking at. Beyond immediate actions, the dorsal stream also contributes to navigation â€“ moving through larger environments. This involves interaction with other brain systems, particularly the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL), which includes the hippocampus. While the dorsal stream provides moment-to-moment spatial awareness and guides movement relative to the immediate surroundings, the MTL is critical for forming and using cognitive maps and spatial memory, allowing for navigation towards unseen goals or along familiar routes. Therefore, navigating complex environments relies on the coordinated activity of both the parietal cortex (dorsal stream) and the medial temporal lobe.",
